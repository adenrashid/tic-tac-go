planning 

// do basic html and css first 
// make a grid 3 by 3 
// make divs for each grid box 
// make the items hidden, and unhidden when clicked on the grid box through DOM principles as we have practiced using classList 
// functions are called on click 
// when one player gets 3 in a row or diagonally, its a win 
    // can program this in an if statement and class name as hidden or unhidden 
// make a pop up only visible when one person wins  
alternate clicking mean its P1 or P2s turn i.e. even clicks are P1 and odd clicks are P2
// customise it for smaller devices i.e. phones 

// make a reset button so you can start the game over again --> on click, reset all of the icons to hidden again and restart the game 

// turns between more than one player --> get computer to say whos turn it is. make it go one at a time. ie player one then player two. need to create seperate variables? 

// at the top of the page you can put the icons that players want to play with, and depending on which one is clicked, go with those in the code 

// for AI, can make it like the pre work exercise, random generation to fill in a box Math.random Math.floor and give the grid boxes numbers ???

// https://www.flaticon.com/packs/pokemon-go/2 to get the icons 

// optional 
    // choose your icon
    // vs AI --> this would include random generation of which grid it would fill
    // expanding board?
